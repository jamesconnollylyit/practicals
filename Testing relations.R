# Use statistical methods to examine
# the relationships between our vars of interest

# beavers dataset
# contains the body temp of 4 beavers captured every 10 mins
# over a day
# We want to examine difference in average body temp
# to evaluate whether body temp is affected by activity

# Hypothesis test
# h0: mean beaver temperature is not affected by activity
# h1: mean beaver temperature is affected by activity

?beavers
str(beaver2)

# vars we'll need
# We'll evaluate beaver temp and activity

# temp = continuous variable
# activity - categorical dicotomous variable
